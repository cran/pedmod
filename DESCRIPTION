Description: Provides functions to estimate mixed probit models using, for 
    instance, pedigree data like in <doi:10.1002/sim.1603>. The models are also 
    commonly called liability threshold models. The approximation is 
    based on direct log marginal likelihood approximations like the randomized 
    Quasi-Monte Carlo suggested by <doi:10.1198/106186002394> with a similar 
    procedure to approximate the derivatives. Graph-based methods are also 
    provided that can be used to simplify pedigrees.
